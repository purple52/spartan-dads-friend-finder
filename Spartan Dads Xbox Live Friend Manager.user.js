/*
 * Here's a basic description of the flow of this little script: Excuse some of
 * my JS and variable naming. This was originally just for managing the Spartan
 * Dads group. It has since expanded
 *
 * When a user visits their friends URL
 * (https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Friends), and they have an IMPORT variable
 * appended (https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Friends?xr=socialtwistnav&IMPORT) we
 * will detect that case, and start a process of importing the spartan companies
 * listed in this file into their friends list, as best as we can.
 *
 * Specifically, we'll first set a session variable of the companies to process
 * (can be a single company, can be dozens) Once that is set, we'll come back to
 * the same friends url
 * (https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Friends?xr=socialtwistnav) without the IMPORT
 * flag.
 *
 * Since we don't trigger the IMPORT logic, we check to see if there are any
 * spartan companies in that session variable, and take the first one and send
 * this browser window out to go get those GamerTags. Once we have those gamer
 * tags, we add them to another session variable and then we'll remove that
 * spartan company from the list (or set it to be empty if this is the last or
 * only one) and send them back to the friends url.
 *
 * If there are more spartan compaies to check, that session variable will still
 * have things to do, so the above logic will run. If, instead, we've managed to
 * create a list of all of those GamerTags we want to add to our friends list,
 * we will sort that list, and then fetch the list of our existing friends so we
 * can compare. Still on the same page load, we run that comparison and create a
 * new session variable of our ToDo list, which is the listing of just the
 * company members who are not already in our friends list.
 *
 * At this point, we'll redirect back to our current friends page, but we'll now
 * have the ToDo list set in the session variable. If that variable is set,
 * we'll take the first name in that list, and ship the user to that particular
 * GamerTag page.
 *
 * When we arrive at a GamerTag page, we're going to check to see if we have the
 * ToDo list variable set. if we do, we know that we need to set this person to
 * be a friend. If it is not set, this is just someone navigating GamerTags, and
 * we shouldn't automatically add them as a friend. We will wait until the page
 * loads, compare the GamerTag to the logged-in username, and if they are
 * different, it will add the GamerTag as your friend for you. Once that's
 * accomplished, it will remove that GamerTag from the ToDo list and forward us
 * back to the friends page. Once there, we'll be able to handle situations
 * where the add didn't happen because of lag, or whatever, in that we'll send
 * the page back to the same URL if necessary, until that user is successfully
 * confirmed as a friend.
 *
 * Coming back to the overall friends list, we detect that we still have a ToDo
 * list, so we take the first one in line and send the page back out. This
 * happens over and over until there are no more GamerTags to process.
 *
 * If you come to the friends page, or to the waypoint pages, if the variables
 * haven't been set, and you're not explicitly starting a new import, nothing
 * should happen. Once you start an import, leave the browser alone until it is
 * finished. If there is an issue, where the site hangs on a particular
 * GamerTag, we may need to explicitly edit the script below by enabling the
 * problemName declaration and removing that specific GamerTag. If the system is
 * stuck somewhere else, you can always reset all the variables to clear (not
 * importing) by visting the clean spot:
 * (https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Friends?xr=socialtwistnav&CLEANME)
 *
 * Any questions or concerns drop me a line in XBox Live. In fact, I'd love to
 * hear from anyone who finds this useful. I'm Vuris.
 *
 * Here are the declarations for your company and for you specifically. All
 * changes should be made here. If you have more than one spartan company, or
 * more than one GamerTag you need to skip, just copy and paste over and over.
